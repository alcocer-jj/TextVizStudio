**StatsModeling** is an interactive Streamlit application for end-to-end regression analysis across 
a wide range of model types. Users begin by uploading a CSV dataset and previewing their data, then 
configure up to four separate models via a clean, expandable UI. Parameters consist of: choosing a 
dependent variable, multiple predictors (including optional interaction terms), fixed‐effects dummies
or panel identifiers, and even analytic weights where supported. 

The app provides 14 estimators, from OLS and LPM to logit/probit, Poisson and negative-binomial 
(including zero-inflated variants), ordered outcomes, and both fixed- and random-effects panel and 
mixed-effects models. Each with dynamic standard-error options (homoskedastic, robust/HC0–HC1, or 
clustered) and a nested “About Standard Errors” expander for non-technical guidance. Advanced settings
let you toggle exponentiated coefficients for interpretability, along with customizing zero-inflation links
and solver methods. Once run, results are presented as formatted summaries and dataframes, with the option 
to export consolidated LaTeX or interactive HTML tables via Stargazer. Designed for both seasoned practitioners 
and newcomers, TBD delivers a highly customizable, yet user-friendly, workflow for exploring and comparing 
regression results on any tabular dataset.

                        #### Predicting Continuous Outcomes
                        - **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You want to predict something like people’s height or test scores based on other factors, and most of your data points hover reasonably close to a line.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Very quick to run and easy to explain (“a one-unit change in X adds β units to Y”).  
                            - **Watch out:** If a few data points are way off the line (outliers) or the spread of errors varies wildly, your results can get skewed.  
                            - **How to read the result:** The coefficient β means “for each one-unit increase in X, the average of Y goes up by β.”

                        - **LPM (Linear Probability Model)**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You need a fast, first-cut estimate of a yes/no outcome (e.g., did someone vote or not?).  
                            - **Why it helps:** Coefficients translate directly into percentage-point changes (e.g., “X increases the chance of voting by 5 points”).  
                            - **Watch out:** Sometimes it predicts probabilities below 0% or above 100%.  
                            - **How to read the result:** A coefficient of 0.05 means a one-unit rise in X boosts the probability of “yes” by 5 percentage points.
                    
                        ---

                        #### Choosing Among Categories
                        - **Logit / Probit**  
                            - **When to pick it:** Your outcome is yes/no and you want predictions that always stay between 0% and 100%.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Keeps your predictions in bounds and handles uneven spread in the data.  
                            - **Watch out:** The raw coefficients aren’t in “percentage points”—you’ll need a quick post-estimate step to get marginal effects.  
                            - **How to read the result:** For Logit, β is a change in log-odds; exp(β) is the odds ratio. For Probit, β is a change in the underlying z-score; use average marginal effects to convert to probability changes.

                        - **Multinomial Logit**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You have three or more options without any natural order (e.g., favorite ice-cream flavor).  
                            - **Why it helps:** Models each choice against a baseline, letting you see how factors shift people toward option A vs. B vs. C.  
                            - **Watch out:** Assumes every new option affects all choices equally (IIA).  
                            - **How to read the result:** A coefficient β for choice j means a one-unit increase in X multiplies the odds of choosing j vs. the baseline by exp(β).

                        ---

                        #### Modeling Counts of Events
                        - **Poisson Regression**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You’re counting events (e.g., doctor visits per year) and your counts cluster around an average.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Fast, interpretable “rate” model (mean equals variance).  
                            - **Watch out:** If you see a lot more spread (variance) than the average, your standard errors will be too small.  
                            - **How to read the result:** β is the log change in the expected count; exp(β) is the multiplicative effect on the rate (e.g., exp(β)=1.2 means 20% more events).

                        - **Negative Binomial Regression**  
                            - **When to pick it:** Like Poisson, but your data show extra “lumpiness” (variance > mean).  
                            - **Why it helps:** Learns an extra dispersion parameter so the model can stretch to fit that extra spread.  
                            - **Watch out:** You need enough data to estimate that extra parameter well.  
                            - **How to read the result:** Same as Poisson: exp(β) gives the factor change in expected count per unit of X.

                        - **Zero-Inflated / Hurdle Models**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You see more zeros than a standard count model expects (e.g., lots of people never visit the ER).  
                            - **Why it helps:** Splits the process into “zero vs. non-zero” and “how many if non-zero,” giving you better fit.  
                            - **Watch out:** They’re more complex—make sure you have good predictors for why zeros occur.  
                            - **How to read the result:**  
                                - **Zero part:** exp(β₀) is the odds ratio of being an “excess zero.”  
                                - **Count part:** exp(β₁) is the rate ratio for non-zero counts.

                        ---

                        #### Ordering Things
                        - **Ordered Logit / Probit**  
                            - **When to pick it:** Your outcome has a clear order but no exact spacing (e.g., ratings like “low,” “medium,” “high”).  
                            - **Why it helps:** Respects the ranking without treating “high vs. medium” the same as “medium vs. low.”  
                            - **Watch out:** Assumes the effect of X is the same across all thresholds.  
                            - **How to read the result:** β shifts the log-odds (or z-score) of being at or above each threshold; use predicted probabilities to see category moves.

                        ---

                        #### Working with Panel Data
                        - **Fixed Effects**  
                            - **When to pick it:** You have multiple observations per entity (e.g., states over time) and want to ignore anything that doesn’t change over time.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Automatically removes unchanging traits (like a state’s geography).  
                            - **Watch out:** You can’t estimate effects of variables that never change.  
                            - **How to read the result:** Coefficients are the within-entity effect: a one-unit change in X for a given entity changes Y by β, holding that entity’s baseline constant.

                        - **Random Effects**  
                            - **When to pick it:** Same panel setup but you believe the unobserved traits aren’t correlated with your predictors.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Lets you include variables that don’t change over time.  
                            - **Watch out:** If that uncorrelated assumption fails, results can be biased—run a Hausman test.  
                            - **How to read the result:** Similar to OLS/GLM: β shows the average change in Y per unit X across entities, accounting for random intercept variation.

                        ---

                        #### Mixing It Up
                        - **Mixed Effects (Multilevel Models)**  
                            - **When to pick it:** Your data is nested (e.g., students within schools) and you want to model both overall trends and group-specific deviations.  
                            - **Why it helps:** Captures variation at each level (school vs. student).  
                            - **Watch out:** Model setup and convergence can be tricky—start simple before adding random slopes.  
                            - **How to read the result:**  
                                - **Fixed part:** β is the average effect of X across all groups.  
                                - **Random part:** The variance component tells you how much the intercepts (or slopes) vary from group to group.

                        **Standard**  
                        - Assumes every observation is independent and has the same variability.  
                        - Use when you believe your data errors are roughly “even” across all cases (e.g., no obvious outliers or groups).  

                        **White (HC0)**  
                        - Adjusts for situations where some points have more scatter than others (heteroskedasticity).  
                        - Good first fix if you see “funnel-shaped” residuals in a scatterplot.  

                        **Robust (HC1)**  
                        - Builds on HC0 but corrects for small sample bias.  
                        - Recommended when you have fewer observations (say, under a few hundred).  

                        **Clustered**  
                        - Accounts for “grouped” data (e.g., students within schools or repeated measures per person).  
                        - Treats all observations in the same cluster as potentially correlated—so your error bars widen appropriately.  
                        - Use when you suspect units within the same group share unmeasured shocks (like students all exposed to the same classroom).
